DESCRIPTION
    All the methods take an extra argument, which is an hash ref. The values
    in the hash ref can be used to override the default "ATTRIBUTES" of this
    object.

FAULT HANDLING
    Each method will die with a "Usage..." string on invalid input, and die
    with the response object, if the response code is something else than
    200.

ATTRIBUTES
  hostname
    The peer hostname or IP address of the webcam. Default: "localhost".

  port
    The peer port or IP address of the webcam. Default: 80.

  username
    Username to use for login at the webcam webserver. Default: "admin".

  password
    Password to use for login at the webcam webserver. Default: "admin".

METHODS
  new
    This is the object constructor. It should receive key/value pairs
    matching the "ATTRIBUTES". It can also take a hash ref, with the same
    key/values.

  snapshot
    Returns a HTTP::Response object, containing a JPEG image in the response
    body.

  move
    Input is a string: "up", "down", "left" or "right". This method returns
    a HTTP::Response object.

  zoom
    Input is a string: "tele" or "wide". This method returns a
    HTTP::Response object

    Input is a string: "near", "far" or "auto". This method returns a
    HTTP::Response object.

  iris
    input is a string: "open", "close" or "auto". This method returns a
    HTTP::Response object.

  save_preset
    Will save a preset with the given id and name. Input is "($id, $name)".
    $name is then used in "goto_preset" to recall a given preset. This
    method returns a HTTP::Response object.

  goto_preset
    Will go th the given preset, previously saved by "save_preset". $name
    can also have the special value "home", which will move the camera to
    the default "home" position. This method returns a HTTP::Response
    object.
